"""Cross-tenant isolation: a caller in org A must not see org B's rows.

The audit found that scoping exists on only 4 of ~35 auto-generated types (via
``facade.types.base.build_prescoped_queryset``), so most of the GraphQL surface returns rows
from every organization to any authenticated user. Nothing in the suite asserted otherwise —
before this file there were exactly two negative-authz assertions in the whole test suite, both
about probes.

``test_actions_are_scoped_to_the_callers_organization`` is the control: ``Action`` *is* one of
the four scoped types, so it passes and proves the harness itself is sound. The remaining tests
exercise unscoped types and are expected to FAIL until scoping is added — they are the
executable statement of the finding.
