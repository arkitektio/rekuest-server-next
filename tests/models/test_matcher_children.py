"""The legacy JSON matchers index children 0-based.

``jsonb -> N`` on an array is 0-based, unlike the 1-based ``WITH ORDINALITY`` index used for the
root ports; the child clause used to add one, so the first child of a demand was compared against
the second stored child and the last stored child could never match.
