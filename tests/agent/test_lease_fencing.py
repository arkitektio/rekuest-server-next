"""The executor write-lease and its fencing token — one test per way liveness used to lie.

Liveness is read as ``connected AND a fresh heartbeat`` (``facade.liveness``), and that read
predicate is fine: ``connected=False`` is a definitive negative, ``connected=True`` is merely
not-yet-refuted and the lease is what makes it trustworthy. What was NOT fine was the *write*
discipline, and each class below pins one of the resulting lies:

* a displaced connection going on renewing the lease it no longer owns,
* a stalled worker resurrecting itself after the sweep already failed its work,
* two concurrent registrations both being handed the same in-flight work,
* two concurrent sweeps both emitting a terminal event for the same task.

These drive ``ModelPersistBackend`` directly (a fresh instance per test isolates its in-memory
grace registries); the socket-level half lives in ``test_protocol_unit`` / ``test_conflict``.
