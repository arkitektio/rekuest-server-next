"""Messages that are used to communicate between the rekuest backend and the agent.

Naming convention — the role lives in the affix and the direction is unambiguous:

- **Backend → Agent commands**: bare imperative (``Assign``, ``Cancel``, ``Pause``).
- **Agent → Backend reports**: bare past/noun (``Completed``, ``Failed``, ``Progress``).
- **Caller → Backend requests**: ``…Request`` suffix (``AssignRequest``, ``CancelRequest``).
- **Backend → Caller acks**: ``…Response`` suffix (``AssignResponse``, ``ControlResponse``).
- **Backend → Caller event stream**: ``…Event`` suffix (``CompletedEvent``, ``ProgressEvent``).

No names collide because commands are imperative, agent reports are bare past-tense, and
the caller stream carries the ``…Event`` suffix (``Pause`` cmd vs ``Paused`` report vs
``PausedEvent`` stream).

    needs GraphQL to read results. Delivery is best-effort (the ``task_caller_{caller_id}``
    channel-layer group); on a brief disconnect events are missed and the caller
    re-inquires on reconnect.

    Correlation: ``task`` is the key the caller already learned from
    ``AssignResponse``. ``event`` is the originating ``TaskEvent`` id (a stable
    dedup handle) and ``seq`` its monotonic PK (an ordering / gap-detection key).
