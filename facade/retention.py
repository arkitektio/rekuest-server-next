"""Retention sweep for terminal task trees.

Tasks were previously kept forever — there was no GC at all. When
``TASK_RETENTION_SECONDS`` is set (> 0), this sweep deletes terminal ROOT tasks whose
``finished_at`` is past the horizon; the ``parent``/``root`` self-FK CASCADEs take the
whole tree with them, along with its TaskEvents, TaskInstructs and Patches
(``Lock.hold_by`` SET_NULLs). A done root can still have a live descendant (a cancel
goes to the mother only), so roots with any not-done member are skipped — sound only
because ``root_id`` is set on every assign-created child (and backfilled by migration).

Retention is an explicit operator opt-in (default 0 = disabled): deleting past runs also
removes them from replay discovery (``reusable_task_for``). 2592000 (30 days) is a
sensible production value.

Triggered by the in-process reaper loop (one batch per slow tick) and by the
``reconcile_tasks`` management command (sweeps to exhaustion).
