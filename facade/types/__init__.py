"""GraphQL object types for the facade app, split into domain submodules.

This ``__init__`` re-exports every public type so the established
``from facade import types`` / ``types.X`` access keeps working.

Because the types densely cross-reference each other (e.g. ``Agent`` references
``Task``), the submodules use
``from __future__ import annotations`` so no annotation is evaluated at import
time (avoiding import cycles). At the bottom of this module every public type is
injected into each submodule's globals, so that the string forward references
resolve against the defining module's namespace when Strawberry builds the schema.
