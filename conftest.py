"""Reserve this run's published host ports before anything else is imported.

The dokker stack publishes Postgres and Redis on fixed host ports, which collide
with any other stack on the machine publishing the same numbers -- several
sibling repos publish 5555/6666 from a compose project that, like this one, is
named after its ``integration`` directory. A collision surfaces as a dokker
CommandError from ``backend_stack`` and takes out every database-backed test.

This lives in the root conftest because ``rekuest.settings_test`` reads the
ports at import time, which happens when pytest-django configures Django --
before any fixture, and before ``tests/conftest.py`` is imported.
