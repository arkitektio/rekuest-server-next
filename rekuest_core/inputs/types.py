    A Port is a single input or output of a action. It is composed of a key and a kind

    Identifiers uniquely identify a specific type of model for the scopes (e.g
    all the ports that have the identifier "@mikro/image" are of the same type, and
    are hence compatible with each other). Scopes are used to define in which context
    the identifier is valid (e.g. a port with the identifier "@mikro/image" and the
    scope "local", can only be wired to other ports that have the same identifier and
    are running in the same app). Global ports are ports that have the scope "global",
    and can be wired to any other port that has the same identifier, as there exists a
    mechanism to resolve and retrieve the object for each app. Please check the rekuest
